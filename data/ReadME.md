# EMSA & CMSA Datasets

## üìñ Overview
This repository contains two bilingual, multi-type metaphor sentiment analysis datasets, all dataset with annotated source domains (**S**), target domains (**T**), metaphor type, and sentiment polarity:  

- **EMSA (English Metaphor Sentiment Analysis)**  
  A reconstructed English dataset based on the LCC dataset.  

- **CMSA (Chinese Metaphor Sentiment Analysis)**  
  A manually re-annotated Chinese dataset based on the CSR and CMRE dataset, designed to fill the gap in metaphor sentiment research for Chinese.

## üìä Data Analysis
We provide figures analyzing the datasets from cultural and linguistic perspectives.  
Examples include co-occurrence of sentiment and metaphor type, high-frequency $S$ and $T$, and gender-based $S$ distributions.  

You can find all analysis figures in the repository under the `docs/figures/` folder.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
To load the dataset in Python:

```python
import json

with open("EMSA/train.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    emsa_train = json.load(f)

with open("CMSA/train.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    cmsa_train = json.load(f)

print(emsa_train[0])
print(cmsa_train[0])
```
